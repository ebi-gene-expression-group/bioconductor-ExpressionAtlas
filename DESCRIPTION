Description: This package is for searching for datasets in EMBL-EBI Expression
    Atlas, and downloading them into R for further analysis. Each Expression Atlas
    dataset is represented as a SimpleList object with one element per platform.
    Sequencing data is contained in a SummarizedExperiment object, while microarray
    data is contained in an ExpressionSet or MAList object.
