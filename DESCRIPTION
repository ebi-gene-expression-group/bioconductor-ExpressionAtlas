Description: This package is for downloading data from specified
        datasets from EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas and loading it into R
        for further analysis. Each Expression Atlas dataset is
        represented as a SimpleList object with one element per
        platform. Sequencing data is contained in a
        SummarizedExperiment object, while microarray data is contained
        in an ExpressionSet or MAList object.
